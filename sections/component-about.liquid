        <p>For centuries the cornerstone of healing has involved relationship, context, compassion, skill, and trust. The 21st-century house of medicine (with assistance from other involved stakeholders) has instead embraced a new paradigm of evidence-based medicine, algorithmic order sets, electronic health records, rigid patient requirements, and physician productivity metrics.</p>
        <p>Yes, something changed.</p>
        <p>It’s time to declare that we have all been played. Unwittingly perhaps, but nevertheless played, played to the hilt. And just as importantly it is time to ask the million-dollar question: Who has played us? Who caused patients to feel like pawns, or even worse, roadkill? Who has driven healers to quit? Who has stripped citizens of their health freedom? Who has too casually discarded the value of “informed consent”?</p>
        <p>I will tell you who the players are — who played you, and who played me.</p>
        <p>I have come to recognize that medically related agendas not centered on patient wellbeing and physician guidance can be a poison to patients and doctors alike. And this is exactly the root of the problem. Schemes emanating from Big Pharma, Big Tech, and Big Government too often do not serve healers or the sick. This triad represents a dangerous and insidious force that works against transparency and health freedom. It is the triad of tyranny. Its appetite is for power, dollars, and control.</p>
        <p>In “We’ve Been Played...Exposing the Triad of Tyranny” I will tell you of a new lens through which to see the forces that would do us harm.</p>
